### Developers and Non-Profits, Connected ###

Developers, come build your portfolio. Non-Profits, get help changing the world.

Developers are always looking to build interesting and valuable products for showcase in their portfolio. Non-profit organizations have limited resources for building interesting and valuable products that help the world. **Procodo** *connects* developers looking to volunteer their coding experience with non-profits looking for talented *pro codo* help.

## Problem ##

Non-profits have a difficult time creating impactful products because of the barriers to **finding** and **affording** talented engineers. Talented engineers have a difficult time finding product ideas that interest them, change the world positively, and would look good in their portfolio.

## Solution ##

**Procodo** breaks down those barriers by creating a user-friendly platform where non-profits can post projects and developers can volunteer their experience working on those projects. **Procodo** makes the search, setup, and management of developer-non-profit projects efficient and simple.

<blockquote>If we can make it easy for non-profits and engineers to share their respective talents, and reward everyone involved in the process, we can generate some big-time social utility ... </blockquote>
